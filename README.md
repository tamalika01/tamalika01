  Good morning Sir/Ma'am,
  
  First of all thank you for providing me an opportunity for the interview.
  
  My name is Tamalika Chowdhury. I am from Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal.
  
  Currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering  from Murshidabad College of Engineering and Technology with 9.35 cgpa till 5th 
  semester. I have done class 12 from Chakdaha Ramlal Academy with 74% in 2019. I have done class 10 from Chakdaha Basanta Kumari Balika Vidyapith with 87% in 2017.

  Talking about my technical skills, I have a keen interest in java, oracle 11g database, sql and git.
  I also have a very good knowledge of web development technologies including html, css, javascript and bootstrap.

  I applied my learning to create a web based project, Number Converter.
  Number Converter is a website which converts number from one format to another format. It supports the conversion from (binary, decimal, hexadecimal, octal) to 
  (binary, decimal, hexadecimal, octal).

  In my leisure time, I love to read story books and drawing.
  
  So, this is all about me.

  Thank you Sir/Ma'am.
